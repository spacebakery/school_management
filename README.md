## Overview
This program simulates a simple school management system, allowing users to manage students, teachers, and courses in a realistic and easy-to-use environment. The simulation provides a comprehensive framework for tracking student grades, assigning teachers to courses, and displaying a summary of the school environment.

## Features
- Manage students, teachers, and courses
- Assign grades to students for each course
- Assign teachers to courses
- Display a summary of the school environment, including student grades and teacher assignments
- Simulate friendships among students
- Randomly assigns grades to students for each course
- Simulates a school environment with multiple students, teachers, and courses

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to model real-world entities such as students, teachers, and courses

## Classes and Methods
- `Student` class: represents a student with attributes such as name, grades, and friends
- `Teacher` class: represents a teacher with attributes such as name and courses taught
- `Course` class: represents a course with attributes such as name, teacher, and students enrolled
- `School` class: represents the school with attributes such as name, students, teachers, and courses
- Methods for adding students, teachers, and courses, as well as assigning grades and simulating friendships

## Example Use Cases
- Create a new school with multiple students, teachers, and courses
- Assign grades to students for each course
- Display a summary of the school environment, including student grades and teacher assignments
- Simulate friendships among students

## Getting Started
To get started with the simulation, simply run the program and follow the prompts to create students, teachers, and courses. You can then use the various methods provided to manage the school environment and simulate different scenarios.

## Requirements
Python 3.8+
No external dependencies required
